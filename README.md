# generic-file-processing-app

A file processing app that can be used as a base for many problem solving exercises.  Many problems involve reading a file, processing the data and outputing a result.  This provides a structure, so that the relevant logic can be inserted to solve the particular problem.

Classes

- FileImporter - reads a file and parses into the required format (data)
- Processor - transforms the data in some way into processed data
- Outputer - uses the processed data to output the desired result
- Main - calls the other classes

Consider adding - Data structure class(es)
